                            <p class="card-text">Having a healthy diet has a lot of benefits. It can help you lose
                                weight or maintain your desired weight. It also can lower your cholesterol and prevent
                                certain health conditions. In general, a healthy diet keeps your body running on a daily
                                basis. Learn how to make healthier food choices.</p>
                            <h6 class="m-2">Path to improved health</h6>
                            <p>The choices you make about what you eat and drink matter. They should add up to a
                                balanced, nutritious diet. We all have different calorie needs based on our gender, age,
                                and activity level. Health conditions can play a role too, including if you need to lose
                                weight. Choose food from all five groups and follow the tips below.</p>
                            <h6 class="m-2">Grains</h6>
                            <p>Choose products that list whole grains as the first ingredient. For example, whole grain
                                breads or whole-wheat flour. Whole grains are low in fat and high in fiber. They also
                                contain complex carbohydrates (carbs), which help you feel full longer and prevent
                                overeating. Avoid products that say “enriched” or contained with other types of grains
                                or flours. They do not have the same nutrients. Hot and cold cereals usually are low in
                                fat. However, instant cereals with cream may contain high-fat oils or butterfat. Granola
                                cereals also may have high-fat oils andextra sugars. Look for low-sugar options instead.
                                Try not to eat rich sweets, such as doughnuts, rolls, and muffins. These foods often
                                contain calories made up of more than 50% fat. Lighter options, such as angel food cake,
                                can satisfy your sweet tooth without adding fat to your diet.</p>
                            <h6 class="m-2">Fruits and Vegetables</h6>
                            <p>Fruits and vegetables naturally are low in fat. They provide flavor and variety to your
                                diet. They also contain necessary fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Try not to add unneeded
                                fats to vegetables and fruits. This means avoiding margarine, butter, mayonnaise, and
                                sour cream. You can use yogurt, healthy oils, or herbs to season instead.</p>
                            <h6 class="m-2">Protein</h6>
                            <p>Beef, pork, veal, and lamb</p>
                            <p>Select low-fat, lean cuts of meat. Lean beef and veal cuts have the words “loin” or
                                “round” in their names. Lean pork cuts have the words “loin” or “leg” in their names.
                                Trim off the outside fat before cooking it. Trim any inside, separable fat before eating
                                it. Use herbs, spices, and low-sodium marinades to season meat.
                                Baking, broiling, grilling, and roasting are the healthiest ways to prepare these meats.
                                Lean cuts can be pan-broiled or stir-fried.</p>

                                gym workout</h3>
                            <p class="card-text">Most people know that they need to keep hydrated in order to stay
                                energised.But it can be easy to underestimate how much hydration can affect your
                                workout. It doesn’t help that there are so many contradictory statistics about how much
                                water we’re meant to drink each day, and how frequently.</p>
                            <h6 class="m-2">So what are we supposed to believe?</h6>
                            <p> We thought it was time to set the record straight. Here’s our definitive guide on how
                                you can stay hydrated before, during and after a workout.</p>
                            <h6 class="m-2">EFFECTS OF DEHYDRATION ON THE BODY</h6>
                            <p>You’d be forgiven for believing that only considerable dehydration can have a detrimental
                                effect on exercise; we’re talking headaches, excessive perspiration and general
                                aches.<br>But did you know that a mere 2% reduction in fluids can result in a 10-20%
                                degradation in performance? That means your performance can be sapped even when you
                                don’t feel dehydrated at all.<br> The tell-tale signs of dehydration are thirst and
                                dark-coloured urine. It can also cause digestive issues and constipation, and can even
                                make you feel hungrier, because a dehydrated brain confuses hunger and thirst. When you
                                spot any of these symptoms, your body needs some water.</p>
                            <h6 class="m-2">HOW MUCH WATER SHOULD I DRINK PER DAY?</h6>
                            <p>The amount of water you should drink per day depends on a number of variables, not least
                                the level of activity you plan to undertake. For example, a marathon runner will
                                obviously have different requirements to somebody who is doing a 30-minute weights
                                session in the gym. <br>
                                The weather can also make a big difference, too, since you’ll sweat a lot more in warmer
                                conditions.<br>
                                General guidelines suggest that you should drink at least 2 litres of water per day. You
                                should increase this by 500ml per hour of intense training, and increase this again if
                                you tend to sweat a lot when you exercise.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Maybe your favorite gym is closed. Maybe you just started working from
                                home and don’t want to venture back out after your day’s over. Or maybe you just want to
                                save yourself some time between all of life’s other obligations. Whatever your reason,
                                working out at home is a popular alternative to traditional gyms and studios — and with
                                a few pro tips, you can make the most of your at-home workout and build habits you can
                                follow for the long term. <br>Because while your couch may be inviting, nothing can
                                jumpstart your day or infuse your afternoon with some energy like a good workout.</p>

                            <h6 class="m-2">1.DEDICATE A SPACE TO EXERCISE </h6>
                            <p>If you’re fortunate enough to have an empty room to put some weights and cardio
                                equipment, great. But many people aren’t so lucky. If you’ve got a small apartment, your
                                dedicated workout space can simply be a mat on the ground or the floorspace that results
                                from moving your coffee table. “Your exercise space doesn’t have to be fancy or large,”
                                says Matthew Martin, a certified personal trainer. </p>
                            <h6 class="m-2">2.FIND A PROGRAM YOU CAN STICK TO</h6>
                            <p>The most common barriers to exercise are a lack of time and motivation. An added barrier
                                to working out at home is not having someone to hold you accountable, like a trainer or
                                other hard-working gym-goers. So to set yourself up for success, find a program you know
                                you will enjoy — that way you’re more likely to stick to it. If you love HIIT, find some
                                virtual classes online or on a workout app. </p>
                            <h6 class="m-2">3. BUILD HABITS INTO YOUR DAILY ROUTINE</h6>
                            <p>If you go to the gym, you’re presented with countless options for working out. If you’re
                                at home, you’re presented with a computer, TV, bed, couch, fridge and other
                                distractions. That’s why it can be helpful to build your workout into your day, rather

                                perform 20 pushups and 20 squats before you shower in the morning. If that goes well,
                                try expanding your workout to 20 minutes of bodyweight exercises. Not a morning person?
                                No problem, dedicate time at lunch to a quick workout or reward yourself with your

                            <h3 class="card-title text-center">Muscle-Building Fundamentals You Need to Learn</h3>
                            <p class="card-text">Building muscle is why most of us constantly return to the gym. It's the beacon of light that continues to drive our effort-driven workouts that many consider us crazy for, but how do we build muscle effectively? That's the question that trips up so many lifters.<br> That's because it's harder to build muscle than you might think. Building muscle isn't simply about going to the gym, and it's not simply about eating pounds and pounds of protein. To build muscle, you must push your muscles to the limit, then let them recover and grow stronger as they do. And to do this, you must create the proper recovery environment for them when you're not in the gym.<br> This means your quest to build muscle involves a host of variables over a 24-hour period. The things you do in the gym to push your muscles to the limit count. So does the "work" you put in during the other 20 or so hours when you're away from the gym, everything from rest to nutrition to active recovery. All of this can affect how you build muscle.<br>One of the best ways to get started is to understand and define what muscle-building actually is. Muscle hypertrophy is the increase in growth of muscle cells, and it's a process that's often kickstarted by resistance training. Essentially, you need to push your muscles hard, often by lifting heavy loads for reps, stimulating the release of muscle-growing hormones and other metabolites.</p>                    
                            <p>Muscle hypertrophy is the adaptation our muscles experience from continual exposure to progressively overloaded forms of resistance training, which then results in an increase in our muscle fiber size, both in diameter and length. Essentially, muscle hypertrophy is the process through which our muscles get physically larger through the act of strategically consistent and harder workouts.<br>Remember, effort is one of the most definitive drivers of muscle gain over time. However, it's just one of the drivers. That effort needs to be coupled with a desire to push your body farther than you might think it's capable of. This is something called "progressive overload." If you're not familiar, progressive overload involves creating some form of increased, strategic effort based on the style of training you're doing. This doesn't mean going heavier and heavier with the weights in every set and every single workout, because sometimes, that's not possible. Over-focus on going heavy in every single workout, and you set yourself up for injury and disappointment.</p>
